\fBndb_mgm \fR\fB\fIoptions\fR\fR
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
The
\fBndb_mgm\fR
management client process is actually not needed to run the cluster\&. Its value lies in providing a set of commands for checking the cluster\*(Aqs status, starting backups, and performing other administrative functions\&. The management client accesses the management server using a C API\&. Advanced users can also employ this API for programming dedicated management processes to perform tasks similar to those performed by
\fBndb_mgm\fR\&.
.PP
To start the management client, it is necessary to supply the host name and port number of the management server:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
shell> \fBndb_mgm [\fR\fB\fIhost_name\fR\fR\fB [\fR\fB\fIport_num\fR\fR\fB]]\fR
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
For example:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
shell> \fBndb_mgm ndb_mgmd\&.mysql\&.com 1186\fR
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
The default host name and port number are
localhost
and 1186, respectively\&.

This option can be used to send a command to the MySQL Cluster management client from the system shell\&. For example, either of the following is equivalent to executing
SHOW
in the management client:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
shell> \fBndb_mgm \-e "SHOW"\fR
shell> \fBndb_mgm \-\-execute="SHOW"\fR
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
This is analogous to how the
\fB\-\-execute\fR
or
\fB\-e\fR
option works with the
\fBmysql\fR
command\-line client\&. See
Section\ \&4.2.3.1, \(lqUsing Options on the Command Line\(rq\&.

If the management client command to be passed using this option contains any space characters, then the command

If the connection to the management server is broken, the node tries to reconnect to it every 5 seconds until it succeeds\&. By using this option, it is possible to limit the number of attempts to
\fInumber\fR
before giving up and reporting an error instead\&.
