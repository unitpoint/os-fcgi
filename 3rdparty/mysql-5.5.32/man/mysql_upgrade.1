mysql_upgrade \- check and upgrade MySQL tables

\fBmysql_upgrade [\fR\fB\fIoptions\fR\fR\fB]\fR
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBmysql_upgrade\fR
examines all tables in all databases for incompatibilities with the current version of MySQL Server\&.
\fBmysql_upgrade\fR
also upgrades the system tables so that you can take advantage of new privileges or capabilities that might have been added\&.
.PP
\fBmysql_upgrade\fR
should be executed each time you upgrade MySQL\&.
.PP
If
\fBmysql_upgrade\fR
finds that a table has a possible incompatibility, it performs a table check and, if problems are found, attempts a table repair\&. If the table cannot be repaired, see
Section\ \&2.12.4, \(lqRebuilding or Repairing Tables or Indexes\(rq
for manual table repair strategies\&.

.PP
On Windows Server 2008, Vista, and newer, you must run
\fBmysql_upgrade\fR
with administrator privileges\&. You can do this by running a Command Prompt as Administrator and running the command\&. Failure to do so may result in the upgrade failing to execute correctly\&.

.PP
You should always back up your current MySQL installation
\fIbefore\fR
performing an upgrade\&. See
Section\ \&7.2, \(lqDatabase Backup Methods\(rq\&.
.PP
Some upgrade incompatibilities may require special handling before you upgrade your MySQL installation and run
\fBmysql_upgrade\fR\&. See
Section\ \&2.12.1, \(lqUpgrading MySQL\(rq, for instructions on determining whether any such incompatibilities apply to your installation and how to handle them\&.
.sp .5v
.RE
.PP
To use
\fBmysql_upgrade\fR, make sure that the server is running, and then invoke it like this:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
shell> \fBmysql_upgrade [\fR\fB\fIoptions\fR\fR\fB]\fR
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
After running
\fBmysql_upgrade\fR, stop the server and restart it so that any changes made to the system tables take effect\&.
.PP
\fBmysql_upgrade\fR
executes the following commands to check and repair tables and to upgrade the system tables:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
mysqlcheck \-\-all\-databases \-\-check\-upgrade \-\-auto\-repair
mysql < \fIfix_priv_tables\fR
mysqlcheck \-\-all\-databases \-\-check\-upgrade \-\-fix\-db\-names \-\-fix\-table\-names
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
Notes about the preceding commands:
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
Because
\fBmysql_upgrade\fR
invokes
\fBmysqlcheck\fR
with the
\fB\-\-all\-databases\fR
option, it processes all tables in all databases, which might take a long time to complete\&. Each table is locked and therefore unavailable to other sessions while it is being processed\&. Check and repair operations can be time\-consuming, particularly for large tables\&.
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
For details about what checks the
\fB\-\-check\-upgrade\fR
option entails, see the description of the
FOR UPGRADE
option of the
CHECK TABLE
statement (see
Section\ \&13.7.2.2, \(lqCHECK TABLE Syntax\(rq)\&.
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
\fIfix_priv_tables\fR
represents a script generated internally by
\fBmysql_upgrade\fR
that contains SQL statements to upgrade the tables in the
mysql
database\&.
.RE
.PP
All checked and repaired tables are marked with the current MySQL version number\&. This ensures that next time you run
\fBmysql_upgrade\fR
with the same version of the server, it can tell whether there is any need to check or repair the table again\&.
.\" mysql_upgrade_info file: mysql_upgrade
.\" mysql_upgrade: mysql_upgrade_info file
.PP
\fBmysql_upgrade\fR
also saves the MySQL version number in a file named
mysql_upgrade_info
in the data directory\&. This is used to quickly check whether all tables have been checked for this release so that table\-checking can be skipped\&. To ignore this file and perform the check regardless, use the
\fB\-\-force\fR
option\&.
.PP
If you install MySQL from RPM packages on Linux, you must install the server and client RPMs\&.
\fBmysql_upgrade\fR
is included in the server RPM but requires the client RPM because the latter includes
\fBmysqlcheck\fR\&. (See
Section\ \&2.5.1, \(lqInstalling MySQL on Linux Using RPM Packages\(rq\&.)
.PP
\fBmysql_upgrade\fR
does not upgrade the contents of the help tables\&. For upgrade instructions, see
Section\ \&5.1.10, \(lqServer-Side Help\(rq\&.
.PP
\fBmysql_upgrade\fR
supports the following options, which can be specified on the command line or in the
[mysql_upgrade]
and
[client]
groups of an option file\&. Other options are passed to
\fBmysqlcheck\fR\&. For example, it might be necessary to specify the
\fB\-\-password[=\fR\fB\fIpassword\fR\fR\fB]\fR
option\&.
\fBmysql_upgrade\fR
also supports the options for processing option files described at
Section\ \&4.2.3.4, \(lqCommand-Line Options that Affect Option-File Handling\(rq\&.
