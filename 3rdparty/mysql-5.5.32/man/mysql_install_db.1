.SH "NAME"
mysql_install_db \- initialize MySQL data directory
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.HP \w'\fBmysql_install_db\ [\fR\fB\fIoptions\fR\fR\fB]\fR\ 'u
\fBmysql_install_db [\fR\fB\fIoptions\fR\fR\fB]\fR
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBmysql_install_db\fR
initializes the MySQL data directory and creates the system tables that it contains, if they do not exist\&.
\fBmysql_install_db\fR
is a shell script and is available only on Unix platforms\&. (As of MySQL 5\&.6,
\fBmysql_install_db\fR
is a Perl script and can be used on any system with Perl installed\&.)
.PP
To invoke
\fBmysql_install_db\fR, use the following syntax:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
shell> \fBmysql_install_db [\fR\fB\fIoptions\fR\fR\fB]\fR
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
Because the MySQL server,
\fBmysqld\fR, needs to access the data directory when it runs later, you should either run
\fBmysql_install_db\fR
from the same system account that will be used for running
\fBmysqld\fR
or run it as
root
and use the
\fB\-\-user\fR
option to indicate the user name that
\fBmysqld\fR
will run as\&. It might be necessary to specify other options such as
\fB\-\-basedir\fR
or
\fB\-\-datadir\fR
if
\fBmysql_install_db\fR
does not use the correct locations for the installation directory or data directory\&. For example:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
shell> \fBscripts/mysql_install_db \-\-user=mysql \e\fR
         \fB\-\-basedir=/opt/mysql/mysql \e\fR
         \fB\-\-datadir=/opt/mysql/mysql/data\fR
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
\fBmysql_install_db\fR
needs to invoke
\fBmysqld\fR
with the
\fB\-\-bootstrap\fR
and
\fB\-\-skip\-grant\-tables\fR
options\&.
.if n \{\
.sp
.\}
.RS 4
.it 1 an-trap
.nr an-no-space-flag 1
.nr an-break-flag 1
.br
.ps +1
\fBNote\fR
.ps -1
.br
.PP
If you have set a custom
TMPDIR
environment variable when performing the installation, and the specified directory is not accessible,
\fBmysql_install_db\fR
may fail\&. If so, unset
TMPDIR
or set
TMPDIR
to point to the system temporary directory (usually
/tmp)\&.
.sp .5v
.RE
.PP
\fBmysql_install_db\fR
supports the following options, which can be specified on the command line or in the
[mysql_install_db]
group of an option file\&. (Options that are common to
\fBmysqld\fR
can also be specified in the
[mysqld]
group\&.) Other options are passed to
\fBmysqld\fR\&. For information about option files, see
Section\ \&4.2.3.3, \(lqUsing Option Files\(rq\&.
\fBmysql_install_db\fR
also supports the options for processing option files described at
Section\ \&4.2.3.4, \(lqCommand-Line Options that Affect Option-File Handling\(rq\&.
