myisam_ftdump \- display full\-text index information

\fBmyisam_ftdump [\fR\fB\fIoptions\fR\fR\fB] \fR\fB\fItbl_name\fR\fR\fB \fR\fB\fIindex_num\fR\fR
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBmyisam_ftdump\fR
displays information about
FULLTEXT
indexes in
MyISAM
tables\&. It reads the
MyISAM
index file directly, so it must be run on the server host where the table is located\&. Before using
\fBmyisam_ftdump\fR, be sure to issue a
FLUSH TABLES
statement first if the server is running\&.
.PP
\fBmyisam_ftdump\fR
scans and dumps the entire index, which is not particularly fast\&. On the other hand, the distribution of words changes infrequently, so it need not be run often\&.
.PP
Invoke
\fBmyisam_ftdump\fR
like this:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
shell> \fBmyisam_ftdump [\fR\fB\fIoptions\fR\fR\fB] \fR\fB\fItbl_name\fR\fR\fB \fR\fB\fIindex_num\fR\fR
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
The
\fItbl_name\fR
argument should be the name of a
MyISAM
table\&. You can also specify a table by naming its index file (the file with the
\&.MYI
suffix)\&. If you do not invoke
\fBmyisam_ftdump\fR
in the directory where the table files are located, the table or index file name must be preceded by the path name to the table\*(Aqs database directory\&. Index numbers begin with 0\&.
.PP
Example: Suppose that the
test
database contains a table named
mytexttable
that has the following definition:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
CREATE TABLE mytexttable
(
  id   INT NOT NULL,
  txt  TEXT NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (id),
  FULLTEXT (txt)
) ENGINE=MyISAM;
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
The index on
id
is index 0 and the
FULLTEXT
index on
txt
is index 1\&. If your working directory is the
test
database directory, invoke
\fBmyisam_ftdump\fR
as follows:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
shell> \fBmyisam_ftdump mytexttable 1\fR
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
If the path name to the
test
database directory is
/usr/local/mysql/data/test, you can also specify the table name argument using that path name\&. This is useful if you do not invoke
\fBmyisam_ftdump\fR
in the database directory:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
shell> \fBmyisam_ftdump /usr/local/mysql/data/test/mytexttable 1\fR
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
You can use
\fBmyisam_ftdump\fR
to generate a list of index entries in order of frequency of occurrence like this:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
shell> \fBmyisam_ftdump \-c mytexttable 1 | sort \-r\fR
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
\fBmyisam_ftdump\fR
supports the following options:
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
