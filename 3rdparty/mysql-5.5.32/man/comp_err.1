.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBcomp_err\fR
creates the
errmsg\&.sys
file that is used by
\fBmysqld\fR
to determine the error messages to display for different error codes\&.
\fBcomp_err\fR
normally is run automatically when MySQL is built\&. It compiles the
errmsg\&.sys
file from the plaintext file located at
sql/share/errmsg\&.txt
in MySQL source distributions\&.
.PP
\fBcomp_err\fR
also generates
mysqld_error\&.h,
mysqld_ername\&.h, and
sql_state\&.h
header files\&.
.PP
For more information about how error messages are defined, see the
\m[blue]\fBMySQL Internals Manual\fR\m[]\&\s-2\u[1]\d\s+2\&.
