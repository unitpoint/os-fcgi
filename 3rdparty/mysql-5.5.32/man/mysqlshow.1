.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
The
\fBmysqlshow\fR
client can be used to quickly see which databases exist, their tables, or a table\*(Aqs columns or indexes\&.
.PP
\fBmysqlshow\fR
provides a command\-line interface to several SQL
SHOW
statements\&. See
Section\ \&13.7.5, \(lqSHOW Syntax\(rq\&. The same information can be obtained by using those statements directly\&. For example, you can issue them from the
\fBmysql\fR
client program\&.
.PP
Invoke
\fBmysqlshow\fR
like this:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
shell> \fBmysqlshow [\fR\fB\fIoptions\fR\fR\fB] [\fR\fB\fIdb_name\fR\fR\fB [\fR\fB\fItbl_name\fR\fR\fB [\fR\fB\fIcol_name\fR\fR\fB]]]\fR

.sp
.RS 4

\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c

.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c

.el \{\

.\}
If no column is given, all matching columns and column types in the table are shown\&.
.RE
.PP
The output displays only the names of those databases, tables, or columns for which you have some privileges\&.
.PP
If the last argument contains shell or SQL wildcard characters (\(lq*\(rq,
\(lq?\(rq,
\(lq%\(rq, or
\(lq_\(rq), only those names that are matched by the wildcard are shown\&. If a database name contains any underscores, those should be escaped with a backslash (some Unix shells require two) to get a list of the proper tables or columns\&.
\(lq*\(rq
and
\(lq?\(rq
characters are converted into SQL
\(lq%\(rq
and
\(lq_\(rq
wildcard characters\&. This might cause some confusion when you try to display the columns for a table with a
\(lq_\(rq
in the name, because in this case,
\fBmysqlshow\fR
shows you only the table names that match the pattern\&. This is easily fixed by adding an extra
\(lq%\(rq
last on the command line as a separate argument\&.
.PP
\fBmysqlshow\fR
supports the following options, which can be specified on the command line or in the
[mysqlshow]
and
[client]
groups of an option file\&.
\fBmysqlshow\fR
also supports the options for processing option files described at
Section\ \&4.2.3.4, \(lqCommand-Line Options that Affect Option-File Handling\(rq\&.
