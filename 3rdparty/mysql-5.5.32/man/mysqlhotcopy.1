mysqlhotcopy \- a database backup program

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBmysqlhotcopy\fR
is a Perl script that was originally written and contributed by Tim Bunce\&. It uses
FLUSH TABLES,
LOCK TABLES, and
cp
or
scp
to make a database backup\&. It is a fast way to make a backup of the database or single tables, but it can be run only on the same machine where the database directories are located\&.
\fBmysqlhotcopy\fR
works only for backing up
MyISAM
and
ARCHIVE
tables\&. It runs on Unix\&.
.PP
To use
\fBmysqlhotcopy\fR, you must have read access to the files for the tables that you are backing up, the
SELECT
privilege for those tables, the
RELOAD
privilege (to be able to execute
FLUSH TABLES), and the
LOCK TABLES
privilege (to be able to lock the tables)\&.
