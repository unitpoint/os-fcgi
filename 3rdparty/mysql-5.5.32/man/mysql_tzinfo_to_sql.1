\fBmysql_tzinfo_to_sql \fR\fB\fIarguments\fR\fR
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
The
\fBmysql_tzinfo_to_sql\fR
program loads the time zone tables in the
mysql
database\&. It is used on systems that have a
zoneinfo
database (the set of files describing time zones)\&. Examples of such systems are Linux, FreeBSD, Solaris, and Mac OS X\&. One likely location for these files is the
/usr/share/zoneinfo
directory (/usr/share/lib/zoneinfo
on Solaris)\&. If your system does not have a zoneinfo database, you can use the downloadable package described in
Section\ \&10.6, \(lqMySQL Server Time Zone Support\(rq\&.
.PP
\fBmysql_tzinfo_to_sql\fR
can be invoked several ways:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
shell> \fBmysql_tzinfo_to_sql \fR\fB\fItz_dir\fR\fR
shell> \fBmysql_tzinfo_to_sql \fR\fB\fItz_file tz_name\fR\fR
shell> \fBmysql_tzinfo_to_sql \-\-leap \fR\fB\fItz_file\fR\fR
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
For the first invocation syntax, pass the zoneinfo directory path name to
\fBmysql_tzinfo_to_sql\fR
and send the output into the
\fBmysql\fR
program\&. For example:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
shell> \fBmysql_tzinfo_to_sql /usr/share/zoneinfo | mysql \-u root mysql\fR
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
\fBmysql_tzinfo_to_sql\fR
reads your system\*(Aqs time zone files and generates SQL statements from them\&.
\fBmysql\fR
processes those statements to load the time zone tables\&.
.PP
The second syntax causes
\fBmysql_tzinfo_to_sql\fR
to load a single time zone file
\fItz_file\fR
that corresponds to a time zone name
\fItz_name\fR:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
shell> \fBmysql_tzinfo_to_sql \fR\fB\fItz_file\fR\fR\fB \fR\fB\fItz_name\fR\fR\fB | mysql \-u root mysql\fR
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
If your time zone needs to account for leap seconds, invoke
\fBmysql_tzinfo_to_sql\fR
using the third syntax, which initializes the leap second information\&.
\fItz_file\fR
is the name of your time zone file:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
shell> \fBmysql_tzinfo_to_sql \-\-leap \fR\fB\fItz_file\fR\fR\fB | mysql \-u root mysql\fR
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
After running
\fBmysql_tzinfo_to_sql\fR, it is best to restart the server so that it does not continue to use any previously cached time zone data\&.
