\fBmysqlaccess\fR
is a diagnostic tool that Yves Carlier has provided for the MySQL distribution\&. It checks the access privileges for a host name, user name, and database combination\&. Note that
\fBmysqlaccess\fR
checks access using only the
user,
db, and
host
tables\&. It does not check table, column, or routine privileges specified in the
tables_priv,
columns_priv, or
procs_priv
tables\&.

If your MySQL distribution is installed in some nonstandard location, you must change the location where
\fBmysqlaccess\fR
expects to find the
\fBmysql\fR
client\&. Edit the
mysqlaccess
script at approximately line 18\&. Search for a line that looks like this:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
$MYSQL     = \*(Aq/usr/local/bin/mysql\*(Aq;    # path to mysql executable
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
Change the path to reflect the location where
\fBmysql\fR
actually is stored on your system\&. If you do not do this, a
Broken pipe
error will occur when you run
\fBmysqlaccess\fR\&.
