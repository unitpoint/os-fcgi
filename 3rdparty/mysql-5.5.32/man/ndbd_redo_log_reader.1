.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
Reads a redo log file, checking it for errors, printing its contents in a human\-readable format, or both\&.
\fBndbd_redo_log_reader\fR
is intended for use primarily by MySQL Cluster developers and Support personnel in debugging and diagnosing problems\&.
.PP
This utility remains under development, and its syntax and behavior are subject to change in future MySQL Cluster releases\&.
.PP
The C++ source files for
\fBndbd_redo_log_reader\fR
can be found in the directory
/storage/ndb/src/kernel/blocks/dblqh/redoLogReader\&.

The following table includes options that are specific to the MySQL Cluster program
\fBndbd_redo_log_reader\fR\&. Additional descriptions follow the table\&. For options common to most MySQL Cluster programs (including

\fIfile_name\fR
is the name of a cluster redo log file\&. redo log files are located in the numbered directories under the data node\*(Aqs data directory (DataDir); the path under this directory to the redo log files matches the pattern
ndb_\fI#\fR_fs/D\fI#\fR/LCP/\fI#\fR/T\fI#\fRF\fI#\fR\&.Data\&. In each case, the
\fI#\fR
represents a number (not necessarily the same number)\&. For more information, see

Like
\fBndb_print_backup_file\fR
and
\fBndb_print_schema_file\fR
(and unlike most of the
NDB
utilities that are intended to be run on a management server host or to connect to a management server)
\fBndbd_redo_log_reader\fR
must be run on a cluster data node, since it accesses the data node file system directly\&. Because it does not make use of the management server, this utility can be used when the management server is not running, and even when the cluster has been completely shut down\&.
