.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBmysql_setpermission\fR
is a Perl script that was originally written and contributed by Luuk de Boer\&. It interactively sets permissions in the MySQL grant tables\&.
\fBmysql_setpermission\fR
is written in Perl and requires that the
DBI
and
DBD::mysql
Perl modules be installed (see
Section\ \&2.14, \(lqPerl Installation Notes\(rq)\&.
.PP
Invoke
\fBmysql_setpermission\fR
like this:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
shell> \fBmysql_setpermission [\fR\fB\fIoptions\fR\fR\fB]\fR
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
\fIoptions\fR
should be either
\fB\-\-help\fR
to display the help message, or options that indicate how to connect to the MySQL server\&. The account used when you connect determines which permissions you have when attempting to modify existing permissions in the grant tables\&.
.PP
\fBmysql_setpermissions\fR
also reads options from the
[client]
and
[perl]
groups in the
\&.my\&.cnf
file in your home directory, if the file exists\&.
.PP
\fBmysql_setpermission\fR
supports the following options:
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
.\" mysql_setpermission: help option
.\" help option: mysql_setpermission
\fB\-\-help\fR
.sp
Display a help message and exit\&.
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
.\" mysql_setpermission: host option
.\" host option: mysql_setpermission
\fB\-\-host=\fR\fB\fIhost_name\fR\fR
.sp
Connect to the MySQL server on the given host\&.
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
.\" mysql_setpermission: password option
.\" password option: mysql_setpermission
\fB\-\-password=\fR\fB\fIpassword\fR\fR
.sp
The password to use when connecting to the server\&. Note that the password value is not optional for this option, unlike for other MySQL programs\&.
.sp
Specifying a password on the command line should be considered insecure\&. See
Section\ \&6.1.2.1, \(lqEnd-User Guidelines for Password Security\(rq\&. You can use an option file to avoid giving the password on the command line\&.
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\

.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
