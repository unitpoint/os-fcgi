  Bug#16779374: NEW ERROR MESSAGE ADDED TO 5.5 AFTER 5.6 GA - REUSING
                NUMBER ALREADY USED BY 5.6
  
  The problem was that the patch for Bug#13004581 added a new error
  message to 5.5. This causes it to use an error number already used
  in 5.6 by ER_CANNOT_LOAD_FROM_TABLE_V2. Which means that error
  message number stability between GA releases is broken.
  
  This patch fixes the problem by removing the error message and
  using ER_UNKNOWN_ERROR instead.

  Bug#16757869: INNODB: POSSIBLE REGRESSION IN 5.5.31, BUG#16004999
  
  The problem was that if UPDATE with subselect caused a
  deadlock inside InnoDB, this deadlock was not properly
  handled by the SQL layer. This meant that the SQL layer
  would try to unlock the row after InnoDB had rolled
  back the transaction. This caused an assertion inside
  InnoDB.
  
  This patch fixes the problem by checking for errors
  reported by SQL_SELECT::skip_record() and not calling
  unlock_row() if any errors have been reported.
    
  This bug is similar to Bug#13586591, but for UPDATE
  rather than DELETE. Similar issues in filesort/opt_range/
  sql_select will be investigated and handled in the scope
  of Bug#16767929

      BUG#16222245 - CRASH WITH EXPLAIN FOR A QUERY WITH LOOSE SCAN FOR 
      GROUP BY, MYISAM 
      
      Problem:-
      In a query, where we are using loose index scan optimization and 
      we have MIN() causes segmentation fault(where table row length 
      is less then key_length).
      
      Analysis:
      
      While using loose index scan for MIN(), we call key_copy(), to copy 
      the key data from record.
      This function is using temporary record buffer to store key data 
      from the record buffer.But in case where the key length is greater 
      then the buffer length, this will cause a segmentation fault.
      
      
      Solution:
      Give a proper buffer to store a key record.

  When logging to the binary log in row, updates and deletes to a BLACKHOLE

  It is impossible to log binary log in row format for updates and deletes to

  After fix, generate a warning for UPDATE/DELETE statements that modify a

      Bug #15973904 INNODB PARTITION CODE HOLDS LOCK_OPEN AND SLEEPS WHILE 
      OPENING MISSING PARTITION
      
      In the ha_innobase::open() call, for normal tables, there is no retry logic.
      But for partitioned tables, there is a retry logic introduced as fix for:
      
      http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=33349  
      https://support.mysql.com/view.php?id=21080
      
      The Bug#33349, does not provide sufficient information to analyze the original
      problem.  The original problem reported by bug#33349 is also minor (just an
      annoyance and no loss of functionality).  Most importantly, the retry logic
      has been introduced without any associated test case.
      
      So we are removing the retry logic for partitioned tables.  When the original
      problem occurs, a different solution will be explored.

  Bug#16073689 : CRASH IN ITEM_FUNC_MATCH::INIT_SEARCH 
  
  Problem:
  In query like
  select 1 from .. order by match .. against ...;
  causes a debug assert failue.
  
  Analysis:
  In union type query like
  
  (select * from order by a) order by b;
  or
  (select * from order by a) union (select * from order by b);
  
  We skip resolving of order by a for 1st query and order by of a and b in 
  2nd query.
  
  
  This means that, in case when our order by have Item_func_match class, 
  we skip resolving it.
  But we maintain a ft_func_list and at the time of optimization, when we 
  Perform FULLTEXT search before all regular searches on the bases of the 
  list we call Item_func_match::init_search() which will cause debug assert 
  as the item is not resolved.
  
  
  Solution:
  We will skip execution if the item is not fixed and we will not 
  fix index(Item_func_match::fix_index()) for which 
  Item_func_match::fix_field() is not called so that on later changes 
  we can check the dependency on fix field.
